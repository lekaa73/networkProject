This project demonstrates the successful implementation of network security through Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Network Address Translation (NAT). By using protocols like Spanning Tree, VLANs, Port Security, and dynamic routing (OSPF/EIGRP), we have created a secure, efficient, and scalable network.
ACLs help control access to sensitive resources, ensuring only authorized users can interact with key parts of the network. NAT protects internal devices by hiding them from external networks, adding an extra layer of security.
Additionally, the use of VLANs and Port Security ensures that the network remains segmented and protected from unauthorized access. Routing protocols improve traffic flow, while EtherChannel increases redundancy and bandwidth availability.
Overall, the project provides a strong foundation for secure and efficient networking, suitable for organizations that prioritize network security and performance. 
This design can be scaled and adapted for future growth, making it ideal for businesses, educational institutions, and other entities that require robust network infrastructure.
